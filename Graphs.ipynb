    "Graphs are another very useful data structure in computer science.  They're highly related to trees.  Indeed, trees are just a subset of graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a collection of nodes and edges linking those nodes.  If the edges have a direction (as in node A connects to node B, which might represent that you can fly from Auckland to Wellington) then the graph is directed.  Unlike with trees, cycles are possible in graphs.  (An example of a cycle could be that you could fly from Auckland to Wellington to Christchurch and then *back to* Auckland.)\n",

    "*What experiences have you had using graphs?*\n",

    "Nodes and Edges\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use exactly the same class to represent nodes as the class we used for trees.  However previously, our `Node` class could contain only two edges.  In general, for both trees and graphs, a node could have many connections to other nodes.  We could store these connections as a list for each node.  This method of storing a graph is called an [adjacency list][adj-list].\n",

It's possible that a node may have a number of attributes.  For example, if a node represented a city, then it could have the name of the city and it's latitude and longitude as attributes.\n",
    "\n",
